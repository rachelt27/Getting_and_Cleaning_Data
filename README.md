# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data : Course Project

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
* Downloads the dataset from UCI website
* Loads the feature,subject and activity data for both training and testing.
* Merges training and testing datasets,keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
* Adds descriptive names to Activity values.
* Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity      pair.
